# Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft: Galactic Space Craft Control

As a scientist at ISRO controlling the latest lunar spacecraft Chandrayaan 3, your task is to develop a program that translates commands sent from Earth into instructions understood by the spacecraft. The spacecraft navigates through the galaxy using galactic coordinates, represented by x, y, z coordinates (x for east or west location, y for north or south location, and z for distance above or below the galactic plane).

## Features

- Move the spacecraft forward/backward (f, b): The spacecraft moves one step forward or backward based on its current direction.
- Turn the spacecraft left/right (l, r): The spacecraft rotates 90 degrees to the left or right, changing its facing direction.
- Turn the spacecraft up/down (u, d): The spacecraft changes its angle, rotating upwards or downwards.
